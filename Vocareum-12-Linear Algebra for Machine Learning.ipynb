    "Assignment Overview\n",
    "This assignment will both test your understand of linear algebra and your ability to translate procedures into code. Some questions will ask you to create your own implementations of linear algebra operations, while others will allow you to take advantage of existing implementations available in libraries, such as numpy and scipy. In this assignment you will implement basic and intermediate linear algebra operations in Python.You will begin by performing matrix addition, substraction, and multplication. You will also use dot product and cross product to perform calculations. You will then move on to more advanced operations such as transpotion, matrix determinant, and inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.\n",

There are an infinite number of solutions that will satisfy the conditions of the equations! To know which solution you want, you have to feed in an x value. This makes the y value dependent on the x value. Attempting to solve a dependent system of linear equations via numpy will throw an error, because the solution depends on your inputs.\n",
