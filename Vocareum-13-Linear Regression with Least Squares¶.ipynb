    "This assignment will test your ability to code your own version of least squares regression in Python. After a brief review of some of the content from the lecture you will be asked to create a number of functions that will eventually be able to read in raw data to Pandas and perform a least squares regression on a subset of that data.\n",

As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.\n",

    "Linear Regression with Least Squares\n",
    "In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In the case of one independent variable it is called simple linear regression. As long as a few basic assumptions are fulfilled, linear regression using least squares is solvable exactly, without requiring approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the equations presented in the lectures in the module can be adapted directly to Python code, making this a good practice for both using Python and translating an \"algorithm\" to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive the desired result, we will use the same matrix version of the least squares solution presented in the lectures. As a reminder, the vector of weights we are trying to find,  wLS , can be computed via:\n",
    "\n",
    "wLS=(XTX)−1XTy,\n",
    " \n",
    "where  X  is the matrix of inputs and  y  is the output vector from the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation,  X  is always defined to have a vector of  1  value(s) as its first column. In other words, even when there is only one input value for each data point,  X  takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "X=⎡⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢1 x111 x21⋮ ⋮1 xn1⎤⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥\n",
    " \n",
    "Similarly, for two inputs per data point,  X  will take this form:\n",

As the square root of a variance, RMSE can be interpreted as the standard deviation of the unexplained variance, and has the useful property of being in the same units as the response variable. Lower values of RMSE indicate better fit. RMSE is a good measure of how accurately the model predicts the response, and it is the most important criterion for fit if the main purpose of the model is prediction.\n",
