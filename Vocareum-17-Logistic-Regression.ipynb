    "Logistic regression offers a way to create a fairly interpretable parametric model for binary classification. This assignment will work through the definition of a logistic regression function in Python. After summarizing the equations and a brief EDA of the 'Titanic' data that we will be using, you will be asked to define many functions that will create a logistic regression.\n",
    "A demonstration of sklearn's implementation of Logistic Regression will close the assignment.\n",

    "Implement the Logistic Regression Algorithm\n",

    "Calculate the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to  w \n",
    "Sum the gradients of the log-likelihood with respect to  w \n",
    "Execute logistic regression, stopping after a particular iteration\n",
    "Determine convergence of the logistic regression algorithm\n",
    "This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort in coding in Python. It will also help you review the key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers to the questions will get increasingly complex. You must adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and giving you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.\n",
