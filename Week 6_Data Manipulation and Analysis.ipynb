    "Assignment Overview\n",
    "In this assignment you will manipulate and analyze data with Pandas. You will begin by reviewing how to read data into a series or dataframe, then you will use additional functionalities of Pandas objects. After that, you will index, select and edit data inside dataframes. In the final parts of the assignment you will be combining, grouping and aggregating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.\n",
