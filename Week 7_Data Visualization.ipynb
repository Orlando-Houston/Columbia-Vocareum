    "Assignment Overview\n",
    "In this assignment you will use matplotlib and pandas to create and customize a number of data visualizations. You will begin by creating a simple line plot and gradually build your skills to create more complex and customized visualizations. You will use pandas to create a pairs plot so you can display multiple scatter plots in one figure. Finally, you will wrap up the assignment by creating a time series visualization in matplotlib. Please review the Important Instructions section below. You must adhere to these instructions to ensure the grading for this assignment works properly in Vocareum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.\n",

    "To be able to test for this module, you will be asked to save your figures as PNG into a folder called \"results\".
